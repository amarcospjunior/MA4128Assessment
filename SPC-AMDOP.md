*Statistical process control (SPC) is a method of quality control which uses statistical methods. 
SPC is applied in order to monitor and control a process.*

With statistical process control (SPC), one aims
to detect and diagnose situations in which a
process has gone out of statistical control. This problem
has both process and statistical aspects to itâ€”for
an outline of some of its statistical modeling aspects,
see Crowder et al. (1997). 

Operationally, the state of
statistical control may be described as one in which
the process readings appear to follow a common statistical
model. One model is that while the process
is in statistical control, the successive process readings
Xi are independent and sampled from the same distribution. 
When the process goes out of control, it
can do so in several ways. 

A distinction can be made
between isolated special causes, those that affect a
single process reading and then disappear, and sustained
special causes, those that continue until they
are identified and fixed. In statistical terms, an isolated
special cause results in a single process reading
(or a single rational subgroup) that appears to come
from some distribution other than the in-control distribution.
It is analogous to an outlier. 

The Shewhart
X with an R- or S- chart is an excellent tool for
detecting special causes that lead to large changes,
whether sustained or isolated. It is less effective for
diagnosing small changes in the process.
